$LOCATION is where DATAtoAbymod.jar is located
$DATA is where all the files are made, stored, and read

1. Copy abpdblib directory from abymod1.14/DATA into $DATA

2. Copy Redundant_LH_Combined_Martin.txt into $DATA
$DATA should only contain the abpdblib and the redundancy text file at this time.

3. Go to $LOCATION and run "java -jar DATAtoAbymod.jar $DATA"
$DATA should have a Sequences folder and an empty Models folder, as well as Commands.txt.

4. In $DATA, run "source Commands.txt"
The generated files will appear in Models.  This may take ~2 days.
